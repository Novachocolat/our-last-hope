In the 2020s, a failed experiment to create the world’s largest nuclear bomb resulted in a dangerous weapon capable
of destroying entire nations. One day, enemies of the nation detonated the bomb, leaving less than 3% of the
population alive, saved by sheltering inside bunkers.
By a miracle, you are among the survivors, along with your friend Larry and a few others. Years later, your
bunker’s radio emitter picks up a message: a group of scientists has built a rocket to evacuate survivors to a new
habitable planet. The rocket launches in three days.
Before you can respond, the transmitter overheats and catches fire. Amid the chaos, you resolve to repair it. Larry,
too scared to leave, suggests opening “Larry’s Store” near the bunker, where you can trade or sell parts for gear
upgrades. Time is running out: only 3 days remain.
