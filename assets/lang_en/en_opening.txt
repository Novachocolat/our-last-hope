In the 2170s, a scientific experiment to create the world's largest nuclear bomb went wrong; she is capable of razing an
entire country. One day, enemies of the nation seized the laboratory to detonate this atomic bomb and do maximum damage.
Having allowed a minimum of time before the explosion, less than 3% of the population was able to survive the explosion
thanks to the few bunkers spread across the country.
By some miracle, you are one of those few survivors, you, your friend Hank, and a handful of other individuals.After a
few years, the transmitter in your bunker begins to emit certain sounds. You therefore decide to calibrate it to hear
the message sent; This is a group of scientists who announced that a rocket has been built to extract the rest of the
population to a planet ready to be colonized and which will take off in 3 days. Just as you want to respond, your
transmitter catches fire due to extreme overheating.
Everyone panics but you decide to go on an adventure to find the parts needed to repair the transmitter. You ask your
friend to come with you but out of fear, Hank suggests that you stay close to the bunker and open his little store,
“Hank's Store” where you can provide him with the parts to repair this transmitter or sell him these parts for upgrade
your equipment. So this is where your adventure begins...
You only have 3 days...
